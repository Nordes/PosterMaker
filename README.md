# PosterMaker
Simple way to build your poster without using paint alike apps.

## idea
The idea is to set all the binding and then after generate a poster based on that. So the UX still need a lot of improvement. It would be nice to have it as a WYSIWYG with a background and some other settings... (wish are here). 

Once the design would be finsihed then Snapshot could be done and an image such as a PNG or PDF could be created.

# To run/build
You require to have dotnet framework + F#... and probably a `dotnet restore` (base directory) + `yarn install` (client folder)

```
.\poster.cmd
```

# Demo site
No demo... not yet... it's almost working.
